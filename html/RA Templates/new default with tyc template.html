                        Rental of this vehicle constitutes a
                        &quot;bailment,&quot; meaning that the use of the
                        Vehicle is for Renter&#39;s own benefit. The Vehicle
                        must be returned to our rental office or other location
                        we specify on the date and time noted in this Agreement
                        and in the same condition received, except for ordinary
                        wear. Our determination of the condition of the Vehicle
                        is subject to a final inspection for damage(s) which may
                        occur in our facilities after drop off, whether or not
                        the vehicle is checked in by an employee and whether or
                        not such damage(s) are immediately recognizable or
                        hidden. This also means that if the Vehicle is returned
                        after closing hours, Renter&#39;s responsibility for
                        damages under this Agreement continues until final
                        inspection even if the damage occurred after the vehicle
                        was returned. To extend the rental, Renter must contact
                        our rental office before the due-in date listed in this
                        Agreement. All Charges may continue to accrue until the
                        return location opens for business. Service to the
                        Vehicle or replacement of parts or accessories during
                        the rental must have our prior approval. Renter must
                        check and maintain all fluid levels, and return the
                        Vehicle with at least the same amount of fuel as when
                        rented.</span

                        >
                        Regardless of fault, you are responsible for all damage
                        to, loss of, or theft of the Vehicle during the rental
                        period resulting from any cause. Subject to the law in
                        the jurisdiction where the Vehicle was rented, your
                        responsibility will include: (a) physical damage caused
                        by collisions, weather, vandalism, road conditions, acts
                        of nature, and any other cause resulting in physical
                        damage to the Vehicle: (b) if we determine that the
                        Vehicle is a total loss, the full fair retail market
                        value of the Vehicle, less salvage; (c) if we determine
                        that the Vehicle is repairable: (A) the difference
                        between the value of the Vehicle immediately before the
                        damage and the value immediately after the damage; or
                        (B) the reasonable estimated retail value or actual cost
                        of repair plus Diminution of Value, meaning the
                        difference between the fair market value of the Vehicle
                        before damage or loss and its value after repairs as
                        calculated by a third&shy; party estimate obtained by us
                        or on our behalf; (d) Loss of Use, which shall be
                        measured by multiplying the daily rental rate noted on
                        this Agreement either by the actual or estimated number
                        of days from the date the Vehicle is damaged until it is
                        replaced or repaired, which you agree represents a
                        reasonable estimate of Loss of Use damages and not a
                        penalty. Loss of Use shall be payable regardless of
                        fleet utilization, whether we had other vehicles in our
                        fleet to rent, the Vehicle would not have been used but
                        for the damage, and regardless of whether we suffered
                        lost profits as a result of the damage; (e) an
                        administrative fee, calculated based on the damage,
                        which you agree is reasonable.</span

                        elect to purchase such coverage at the time of rental.
                        You agree that it is your responsibility to know and
                        understand what insurance coverage you have or elect to
                        purchase for this rental. Your liability insurance
                        coverage must provide at least the minimum limits of
                        coverage required by the financial responsibility laws
                        of the state where the loss occurs. If we are required

                        soon as you discover them and are safe out of danger;
